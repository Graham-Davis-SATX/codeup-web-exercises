                <dl id="nationalParks">
                    <dt>Big Bend National Park and Big Bend State Park</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible"><strong>Top tip:</strong> Big Bend is located along a major migration pathway for hundreds of species of birds. Many northern species spend winters in the park, while birds from the tropics flock to the Rio Grande in the spring to mate and raise their young. Some species, like the Colima warbler, are found nowhere else in the US, making Big Bend a life-list destination for avid bird watchers.</dd>
                    <dt>Guadalupe Mountains National Park</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible"><strong>Top tip:</strong> For the biggest views in Texas, hike to the state's highest point: 2,667-metre Guadalupe Peak. A trail from the Pine Springs campground winds up more than 900 metres of elevation in 4.2 miles to the top of the Lone Star state, marked by a metal pyramid. The hike can be completed year round.</dd>
                    <dt>Hueco Tanks State Historic Site</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible"><strong>Top tip:</strong> Peak climbing season runs from October to March, with an annual Hueco Rock Rodeo held in February. Climbers from all over the world show up to compete and take part in instructional clinics. Spectators welcome.</dd>
                    <dt>Palo Duro Canyon State Park</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible"><strong>Top tip:</strong> During the summer months, an outdoor musical drama called simply "TEXAS" lights up the Pioneer Amphitheater in the Park on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. As the official play of the State of Texas, the family-friendly show depicts the trials and triumphs faced by the settlers of the Panhandle.</dd>
                    <dt>Caprock Canyons State Park and Trailway</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible"><strong>Top tip:</strong> The Trailway is a 64-mile hiking, biking and equestrian trail that runs through the park following the abandoned Fort Worth and Denver Railroad line between Estelline and the South Plains. The trail passes through three counties, across 46 bridges and through the Clarity Tunnel, home to a half-million Mexican free-tailed bats during the summer months.</dd>
                    <dt>Enchanted Rock State Natural Area</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible"><strong>Top tip:</strong> You don't have to be a hardcore climber to reach the top of Enchanted Rock. A 0.6-mile walking trail runs from the base up to the rounded summit. Parts of the trail are steep and the rock can be slippery when wet, but the short, spectacular hike is well worth the effort for the 360-degree views.</dd>
                    <dt>Garner State Park</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible"><strong>Top tip:</strong> With around 350,000 visitors annually, Garner is the most popular Texas State Park for camping since it opened in the early 1940s, according to TPWD. Even before it was acquired by the state, the Magers family owned part of the land and ran a camp in the 1920s. In this photo, campers are seen at Garner State Park in July 1972.</dd>
                    <dt>Lost Maples State Natural Area</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible"><strong>Top tip:</strong> The Park posts "fall foliage reports" on their website during the peak leaf season. Weekends can get crowded and Parking is limited so aim to visit on a weekday. Cabin rentals are available in nearby Vanderpool.</dd>
                    <dt>Pedernales Falls State Park</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible"><strong>Top tip:</strong>The 5,212-acre park is known for spectacular hiking trails as well as its swimming holes. Yet, the placid Pedernales River can rage with monster flash floods in minutes.</dd>
                    <dt>Zilker Metropolitan Park</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible"><strong>Top tip:</strong> Texas can be sweltering hot so it's no wonder that the Barton Springs Pool in Zilker park is one of Austin's most popular attractions. This three-acre pool, fed from underground springs, averages 21C (70F) and is open to the public year-round.</dd>

                <ul id="parkFact">
                    <li>Located in the core of the Hill Country, Pedernales Falls is distinguished by huge slabs of ancient limestone that have been gouged by furious floodwaters of the Pedernales River.</li>
                    <li>The limestone riverbed of the Pedernales is roughly 300 million years old.</li>
                    <li>Spanish explorers in the 1700s named the river "pedernales" for the flint rock found in the riverbed, which was used by the Native Americans for arrow and dart points.</li>
                    <li>People have lived in the vicinity for 10,000 years. In the 19th century, hostile Comanche raids pushed out the Lipan Apaches who lived there.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="parkFactsToggle">Big Bend National Park <span style="font-size: .45em; color: #B4B4B4">(Double click to view the facts)</span></h3>
                <ul id="parkFact">
                    <li>Langford Hot Springs near the park's Rio Grande was formed by volcanic activity is about 105 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                    <li>The Chisos Mountains were formed nearly 35 millions years ago after volcanic activity spewed layers of ash and molten rock squeezed up through the ground.</li>
                    <li>The park spans 801,163 acres, which is about 1,252 sq. miles.</li>
                    <li>Two seas, back-to-back, covered the region and subsided hundreds of millions of years ago. As a result, there are thick deposits of shale and limestone.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul id="parkFact">
                    <li>The park's rock formations were created in the Cretaceous age, which ended around 65 million years ago</li>
                    <li>Before tubers flocked to the river, natives camped in the area...12,000 years ago. Aborigines chose to live in the area because of its plentiful game, useful plants and dependable Frio River.</li>
                    <li>Garner is one of 31 existing Texas parks built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The CCC provided 2.5 million young men with outdoor jobs in camps across the U.S. from 1933 to 1942, according to the TSHA. Enrollees helped build 56 parks in Texas, of which 31 are still in operation, including Bastrop and Palo Duro Canyon state parks.</li>
                    <li>Bald cypress trees that line the Frio River live to be 600 years old. The trees stand at 120 feet tall and tower over Garner State Park and the Frio River. According to TPWD, some trees have lived over 1,000 years.</li>
